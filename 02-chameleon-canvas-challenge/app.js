  1. Understand and utilize DOM input events.
  2. Manipulate the style properties of DOM elements.

Brief:
You're presented with a canvas and a color picker. Your task is to implement the functionality to change the background color of the canvas based on the color selected in the color picker.

Expected Outcomes:
  1. When a color is selected using the color picker, the canvas should instantly reflect that color.
  2. The canvas should always display the current color selected in the color picker.
